# Stack
This is a fun game I implemented because I remember seeing these in the App Store or online. 

## How to Play
When you click the Play button, an initial block starts on the ground, and another one moves on top of it. By clicking the space bar, you are trying to land the moving block on the block below. Any difference in alignment will be cut off, causing the landing width to be even shorter for the next block that comes.

## Objective 
To stack as many blocks on each other as possible.

## How the Game Ends
The game ends when the moving block is too small to be visible or placed, or when the block the player tries to place misses the bottom block completely.

## Have Fun Playing This Game!
